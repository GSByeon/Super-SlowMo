# VideoExpansion

This repository contains a PyTorch implimentation of "Super SloMo: High Quality Estimation of Multiple Intermediate Frames
for Video Interpolation", Jiang et. al. CVPR 2018

The repo is in it's initial stages. This can be used as a reference to build upon. I haven't added all the losses yet and the model trains only with MSE Loss as of now.
